# RemmyChat - Message Placeholder Parsing Example
# This file demonstrates how to use the new message placeholder parsing feature

# To enable placeholder parsing in chat messages, configure these options in config.yml:
# features:
#   parse-placeholders-in-messages: true      # For custom placeholders (defined below)
#   parse-papi-placeholders-in-messages: true # For PlaceholderAPI placeholders

# Example placeholders that players can use in their chat messages
placeholders:
  # Basic emoji replacements
  heart: "<red>❤</red>"
  star: "<yellow>⭐</yellow>"
  diamond: "<aqua>💎</aqua>"
  fire: "<gold>🔥</gold>"

  # Emoticons
  laugh: "<yellow>😂</yellow>"
  thumbs-up: "<green>👍</green>"
  thinking: "<gray>🤔</gray>"
  shrug: "<gray>¯\\_(ツ)_/¯</gray>"

  # Styled text expressions
  gg: "<gradient:green:lime><bold>GG!</bold></gradient>"
  lol: "<italic><yellow>LOL</yellow></italic>"
  nice: "<gradient:blue:cyan>Nice!</gradient>"
  wow: "<gradient:gold:yellow><bold>WOW!</bold></gradient>"

  # Gaming expressions
  ez: "<green><bold>EZ</bold></green>"
  rip: "<dark_red>RIP</dark_red>"
  noob: "<gray>noob</gray>"
  pro: "<gradient:purple:pink><bold>PRO</bold></gradient>"

  # Server-specific placeholders
  welcome: "<rainbow>Welcome to the server!</rainbow>"
  rules: "<click:run_command:/rules><hover:show_text:'Click to view server rules'><gold>[Rules]</gold></hover></click>"
  discord: "<click:open_url:https://discord.gg/yourserver><hover:show_text:'Join our Discord!'><color:#5865F2>Discord</color></hover></click>"

  # Complex nested placeholders
  celebration: "%star% %fire% %heart% %star%"
  victory: "%gg% %thumbs-up% %fire%"
  farewell: "Goodbye! %heart% %star%"
# Example usage in chat:
#
# Custom placeholders (when parse-placeholders-in-messages: true):
# Player types: "Great game everyone! %gg% %heart%"
# Result: "Great game everyone! GG! ❤"
#
# Player types: "That was amazing %wow% %celebration%"
# Result: "That was amazing WOW! ⭐ 🔥 ❤ ⭐"
#
# Player types: "Check out our %discord% and read the %rules%"
# Result: Interactive links with hover effects
#
# PlaceholderAPI placeholders (when parse-papi-placeholders-in-messages: true):
# Player types: "My balance is %vault_eco_balance% coins!"
# Result: "My balance is 1,250.50 coins!"
#
# Player types: "Hello, I'm %player_name% from %player_world%"
# Result: "Hello, I'm Steve from world"
#
# Combined usage (when both options are enabled):
# Player types: "I'm %player_name% and that was %gg% %heart%"
# Result: "I'm Steve and that was GG! ❤"

# Security considerations:
# Custom placeholders (parse-placeholders-in-messages):
# - Generally safe since you control all placeholder definitions
# - Be careful not to define placeholders that could be misused for spam
# - Avoid placeholders that could reveal sensitive server information
#
# PlaceholderAPI placeholders (parse-papi-placeholders-in-messages):
# - Gives players access to ALL installed PlaceholderAPI placeholders
# - Consider what information you want players to be able to display
# - Some placeholders might reveal sensitive data (coordinates, IPs, etc.)
# - Test thoroughly and consider which expansions you have installed
# - Both features are disabled by default for security reasons
